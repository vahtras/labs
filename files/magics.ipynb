    "# On magic commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter notebook has inherited som magic commands from iPython (i for interactive) which is terminal-based ineractive Python interpreter and with more features than the standard Python interpreter. The magic commands come in two forms, line magic and cell magic. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Line magic\n",
    "\n",
    "Line magic starts with a command with an initial percent sign `%` and the rest of the line is considered argument to that command, e.g.to list the files in the current folder\n",
    "\n",
    "    % ls\n",
    "    \n",
    "This works the same way on Linux/Mac and Windows. The underlying call for Linux/Mac is the bash `ls` command and in for Windows/DOS the `dir` command. Within a cell you can have several line-magic commands and also intermix them with ordinary Python statements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cell magic\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell magic is a command with double percent signs `%%` and takes the whole cell as input for this command. For example one may write a script in bash in a cell that is executed when the first line is `%%bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "    %%bash\n",
    "    # list content of HOME folder\n",
